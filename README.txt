# Predictive Maintenance Model for Oil Drilling Equipment

## Overview

This repository contains code for a machine learning model built using TensorFlow and Python to perform predictive maintenance on oil drilling equipment. The model analyzes sensor data to predict potential failures, thereby reducing downtime and maintenance costs.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- TensorFlow (version 2.0 or higher)
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Usage

1. **Data Collection**: Gather sensor data from the oil drilling equipment and store it in a CSV file named `sensor_data.csv`.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Run the code to preprocess the data, handle missing values, and normalize features.

3. **Model Training**: Train the predictive maintenance model using the preprocessed data. Adjust hyperparameters as needed to optimize performance.

4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model's performance using validation data.

5. **Deployment**: Deploy the trained model for real-time predictions in the production environment.
